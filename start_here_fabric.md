# Adaptive video

_Fraida Fund ffund@nyu.edu_

This experiment explores the tradeoff between different metrics of video quality (average rate, interruptions, and variability of rate) in an adaptive video delivery system.

It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment.

**Preqreuisites**: To run this experiment on [FABRIC](https://fabric-testbed.net/), you should have a FABRIC account and be part of a FABRIC project. You should have already configured your JupyterHub environment in FABRIC following the instructions [here](https://github.com/fabric-testbed/jupyter-examples/blob/master/fabric_examples/fablib_api/configure_environment/configure_environment.ipynb).
