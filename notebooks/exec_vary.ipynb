    "For some traces, the throughput is always more than enough to steam the video at the highest quality level. For the traces where the throughput is *not* sufficient to stream continuously at the highest quality level, a good decision policy should still be able to smooth over the variation in network quality and deliver high quality video without rebuffering.\n",
