    "\n",
    "For this section, you will need an SSH session on the “router” node and one on the “romeo” node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment with constant bit rate, you may not have experienced any rebuffering.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how the video client works when there is a temporary interruption in the network, try repeating this experiment, but during the video session, reduce the network data rate to a very low value in middle of the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the “router”, set a constant bit rate of 1000 Kbits/second with\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "bash rate-set.sh 1000Kbit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, on the client (“romeo”), start the DASH player with the “basic” adaptation policy:\n",

    "``` bash\n",
    "python3 ~/AStream/dist/client/dash_client.py -m http://192.168.1.2/media/BigBuckBunny/4sec/BigBuckBunny_4s.mpd -p 'basic' -d\n",

    "\n",
    "Leave this running for a while. Then, on the “router”, reduce the network data rate to 50 Kbits/second:\n",

    "    bash rate-set.sh 50Kbit\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time has elapsed, restore the original data rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "bash rate-set.sh 1000Kbit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, after a little while longer, stop the video client on “romeo” with Ctrl+C.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the logs produced by the client will be located inside a directory named `ASTREAM_LOGS` in your home directory on the “romeo” node. Use\n",
