    "Compare adaptive video policies\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, you will need an SSH session on the “router” node and one on the “romeo” node.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous experiment, in this experiment we will use a constant bit rate, with a brief interruption. However, we will compare the way two video adaptation policies react to this interruption - we’ll compare a *rate based policy* (`basic`) and a *buffer based policy* (`netflix`) under identical settings (similar “high” network rate, “low” data rate, similar duration of the “high” data rate before the interruption, and and similar duration of the “interruption”).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rate-based vs. buffer-based policies\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rate adaptation policy (`basic`) chooses a video rate based on the observed download rate. It keeps track of the average download time for recent segments, and calculates a running average.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the download rate exceeds the current video rate by some threshold, it may increase the video rate. If the download rate is lower than the current video rate, it decreases the video rate to ensure smooth playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the source code for the `basic` policy here: [basic\\_dash2.py](../AStream/dist/client/adaptation/basic_dash2.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "The buffer-based policy (`netflix`) adapts the video rate based on the current buffer occupancy, rather than the current download rate. When there are many segments already buffered, it can increase the video rate; if the buffer occupancy is low and the client is at risk of rebuffering, it must decrease the video rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the source code for the `netflix` policy here: [netflix\\_dash.py](../AStream/dist/client/adaptation/netflix_dash.py). This policy is based on the paper:\n",

In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGCOMM workshop on Future human-centric multimedia networking (FhMN ’13).

    "\n",
    "The policy defines two buffer occupancy thresholds: reservoir (defaults to 10%) and cushion (defaults to 90%). If the buffer occupancy is below the reservoir threshold, it selects the minimum video rate to fill the buffer quickly. If the buffer is within the reservoir and cushion range, it selects a video rate using a rate map function that maps buffer occupancy to video rate according to some increasing function. If the buffer occupancy exceeds the cushion threshold, it selects the maximum video rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief explanation of the key variables in this policy follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Reservoir**: Imagine you have a water tank that supplies water to your house. The “reservoir” in this context is like the water level at the bottom of the tank. It’s the minimum amount of water that needs to be there at all times to ensure a steady and uninterrupted water supply. If the reservoir is too low, you might experience water interruptions. Similarly, in video streaming, the reservoir is the minimum amount of video content that must be stored in the buffer to ensure a smooth playback experience. It’s like having a small reserve of video data to prevent any pauses or disruptions if there are temporary changes in network conditions.\n",
    "-   **Cushion**: Think of a cushion on a couch. It’s a soft layer that provides comfort and support. The “cushion” in this context is like an extra layer of video content stored in the buffer above the reservoir level. It’s there to give extra protection against sudden changes. Just as a cushion absorbs some impact, this cushion of video content absorbs any fluctuations in network performance. In video streaming, the cushion is an additional amount of video data stored in the buffer beyond the reservoir level. It’s like having a padding of video content that helps maintain a consistent and uninterrupted playback experience, even when there are brief variations in network speed.\n",
